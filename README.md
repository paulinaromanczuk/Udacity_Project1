# Udacity_Project1 - explore weather trends

>Aim of this project was to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends.


>I've analyzed few countries that I've had a vivid interest in living in at some point... but not anymore after looking at the graph and seeing that Poland has been and still is the coolest country, which may be a pretty important factor with climate crisis we're living in! (the power of data, right?)
Although looking at data from 1970  looks like capitalism has made its mark on Poland in the last 60 years and resulted in quite an increase in average temperature
